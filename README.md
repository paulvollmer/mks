# mks

## Getting Started
`mks` is a tool to create files and the intermediate directories.

## Installation

```sh
go get github.com/paulvollmer/mkt

## Usage
The philosophy behind `mks` is simplicity. With the following command you can create a file `foo.txt` inside the `path/to` directory.

```sh
mks path/to/foo.txt
```

## Development

```sh
git clone git@github.com:paulvollmer/mks.git
cd mks
make
# is equivalent to
# make fmt
# make build
```
